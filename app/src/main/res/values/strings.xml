    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_1">Don\'t go to bed without brushing your teeth</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_1">Brushing before bed gets rid of the germs and plaque that accumulate throughout the day.</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_2">Brush properly</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_2">The way you brush is equally important — in fact, doing a poor job of brushing your teeth is almost as bad as not brushing at all. </string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_3">Don\'t neglect your tongue.</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_3">Plaque can also build up on your tongue. Not only can this lead to bad mouth odor, but it can lead to other oral health problems.</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_4">Use a fluoride toothpaste.</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_4">When it comes to toothpaste, there are more important elements to look for than whitening power and flavors.</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_5">Flossing is as important as brushing.</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_5">Flossing once a day is usually enough to reap these benefits.</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_6">Consider mouthwash</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_6">Mouthwashes are useful as an adjunct tool to help bring things into balance</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_7">Drink more water</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_7">Drink water after every meal. This can help wash out some of the negative effects of sticky and acidic foods and beverages in between brushes.</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_8">Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_8">Eating fresh, crunchy produce not only contains more healthy fiber, but it is also the best choice as far as your teeth are concerned</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_9">Limit sugary and acidic foods</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_9">Sugar converts into acid in the mouth, which can then erode the enamel of your teeth</string>

    <string name="notifications_hdl_healthy_habits_10">See your dentist at least twice a year</string>
    <string name="notifications_txt_healthy_habits_10">At minimum, you should see your dentist for cleanings and checkups twice a year</string>
